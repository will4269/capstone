Huds, raycasting, 

Indirect control is ideal when controlling multiple actors

provide location

they provide movement

Those games with indirect controls are typically strategy games

need raycasting, remote movement, HUD scripting, dash of AI

-------------------------------------------------

Raycast

Ray is a streching line segment from a point.

Needs point and direction

First hit calls RayCastHit

Script {Ray}
-requires origin
-requires direction
-maxdist optional
-Layermask (ignore collisions)
-QueryTriggerInteraction(can it hit triggers)

Physics.Raycast(origin, direction, out hit)
passing to a definition for hit, 

data sturct returned called RaycastHit.
Temporary stored in hit

stores vital information about collison
{Collider, point, rigidbody, distance, transform} of what we hit

put this in update()

launchpoint
navpoint
temp
hudscript

Var (you figure out the data type) {late binding}
